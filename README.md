Metamon

To run:
-Clone repo to local machine (only windows sorry)
-Have .NET installet (some new version probably)
-Run 'dotnet build' -> 'dotnet run' inside a console in the root folder
  -note: console needs clear functionality (for example vscode console does not work)
  -I suggest using Windows Powershell

To map controls:
-Inside Duel.cs, change mappings according to your device. This is pretty manual so gl.
